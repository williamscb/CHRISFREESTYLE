        <p>This is my new projects page I am going to be talking about what each project does for us.
        Portfolio 1: Portfolio 1 welcomed you to the coding world by doing a very simple website using html.
        During that project we also got used to using HTML
        This project (Portfolio 2) is a more complex project that introduces you
        to bootstrap and you use the knowledge that you know from portfolio 1 
        to make your html protfolio look like a professional websit''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''\\\\\\\\\\\\\</p>
